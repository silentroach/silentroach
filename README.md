### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Igor and I write code in Node.js. I can use Javascript, but like strong types so prefer Typescript in strict mode.

Was lucky to work in well-known companies like Avito (was a part of "A-Team"), OneTwoTrip, X5 and Raiffeisen Bank.

The most interesting thing I developed last time was a daemon in Node.js to replicate MongoDB Changestream into PostgreSQL. In short it was an initial binary `copy` and then translating changes via transaction batches with ability to normalize and calculate something from this data in real-time.

Currently I'm looking for a job as senior/lead backend developer in Node.js with relocation for my family ðŸšœ
