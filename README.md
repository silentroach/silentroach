Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Igor *[eeÂ·gor]*, and I write code in Node.js, mostly in Typescript. In my free time, I enjoy riding my Onewheel, running, and exploring new places.

Currently, I hold the position of Principal Engineer at inLocal FZE, based in Dubai.

Before joining inLocal, I was fortunate enough to be a part of well-known companies such as [Avito](https://www.avito.ru "The largest classified in the world"), [OneTwoTrip](https://www.onetwotrip.com/en-us/ "Hotel search engine"), [Raiffeisen Bank](https://www.raiffeisen.ru/en/), and [X5](https://www.x5.ru/en/ "Top-3 grocery delivery service").

With 20+ years of experience, including work on top-tier high-load projects, I can assist you as a consultant by reviewing your project's backend code in TypeScript or JavaScript. I'll identify weak spots, security issues, and areas that can be optimized.
