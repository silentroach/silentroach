Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Igor *[eeÂ·gor]*, and I write code in Node.js, mostly in Typescript. In my free time, I enjoy riding my Onewheel, running, and exploring new places.

Currently, I'm looking for a new job in Dubai, you can [find my CV on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silentroach/).

I was fortunate enough to be a part of well-known companies such as [Avito](https://www.avito.ru "The largest classified in the world"), [OneTwoTrip](https://www.onetwotrip.com/en-us/ "Hotel search engine"), [Raiffeisen Bank](https://www.raiffeisen.ru/en/), and [X5](https://www.x5.ru/en/ "Top-3 grocery delivery service").
