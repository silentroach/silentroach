Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Igor *[eeÂ·gor]*, and I write code in Node.js, mostly in Typescript. In my free time, I enjoy riding my Onewheel, running, and exploring new places.

Currently, I hold the position of Principal Engineer at [inDrive](https://github.com/indriver), based in Dubai.

Before joining inDrive, I was fortunate enough to be a part of well-known companies such as [Avito](https://www.avito.ru "The largest classified in the world"), [OneTwoTrip](https://www.onetwotrip.com/en-us/ "Hotel search engine"), [Raiffeisen Bank](https://www.raiffeisen.ru/en/), and [X5](https://www.x5.ru/en/ "Top-3 grocery delivery service").

If you're a company interested in offering me an opportunity, especially if it involves relocation ðŸšœ to the United States, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
