### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Igor *[eeÂ·gor]* and I write code in Node.js. I prefer strong types so I'm using Typescript in strict mode.

Was lucky to work in well-known Russian companies like [Avito](https://www.avito.ru), [OneTwoTrip](https://www.onetwotrip.com/en-us/), [X5](https://www.x5.ru/en/) and [Raiffeisen Bank](https://www.raiffeisen.ru/en/).

The most interesting thing I developed last time was a daemon in Node.js that replicates MongoDB Changestream into PostgreSQL. In short it was an initial binary `copy` and then translating changes via transaction batches with ability to normalize and calculate something from this data in real-time.

Currently I'm looking for a job as senior/lead backend developer in Node.js with relocation for my family to US/UK ðŸšœ 

Against the Putin's War in Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
