Hi 👋

I'm Igor _[ee·gor]_, and I write code in Node.js, mostly in Typescript. Currently, I'm working as a lead developer in the Node.js platform team at [ecom.tech](https://ecom.tech/). In my free time, I enjoy riding my Onewheel, running, and exploring new places.

Also I was fortunate enough to be a part of well-known companies such as [Avito](https://www.avito.ru "The largest classified in the world"), [OneTwoTrip](https://www.onetwotrip.com/en-us/ "Hotel search engine") 🇺🇦, [X5](https://www.x5.ru/en/ "Top-3 grocery delivery service"), and [Raiffeisen Bank](https://www.raiffeisen.ru/en/).
